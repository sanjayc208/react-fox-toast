## Installation Steps

1. Install package with npm / pnpm / yarn
    ```
    npm i react-fox-toast
    ```
2. Add `ToastContainer` on top of the Application  
   Adding `ToastContainer` on the Component where `toast` hook will be used also works

    ```
    import { ToastContainer } from "react-fox-toast"

    // Add ToastContainer to Main application component
    const App = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <ToastContainer />
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

3. Import `toast` from `react-fox-toast`  
   Use this in any JSX/TSX component and if using NEXT.JS then see to it that there is `'use client';` on top. Since react-fox-toast supports only client side

    ```
    import { toast } from "react-fox-toast"

    // Use this toast functionality on any component
    toast.success('Successfully created a toast')
    ```
