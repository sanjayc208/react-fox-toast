# What's New: Envelope Toast

The **Envelope Toast** introduces a new way to display expandable toasts. It's perfect for cases where you need to show more content in a toast notification and want to allow the user to reveal additional details with a simple action, like opening an envelope.

## What is Envelope Toast?

Envelope Toast is a special toast type that allows users to expand the content of a toast message with a single click. Think of it as an envelopeâ€”once clicked, the content inside gets revealed. The core feature of the Envelope Toast is the ability to "unwrap" a detailed message or information with an interactive action. This pattern is commonly used for showing extra details in toasts that may otherwise overwhelm the user if shown in full. The use of a click action, similar to opening an envelope, adds an element of engagement to the notification.

## Example of Envelope Toast

Below is an example code snippet demonstrating how to use the Envelope Toast in your application:

```
toast.envelope(
  <>A new Message from 'John Mayer'
    <span className="text-xs text-blue-600">...open msg</span></>, {
  expandedContent: (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-2 mx-auto space-y-3">
        <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700">Message: Hello, How are you?</p>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Add Message here.."
            className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg shadow-sm w-full" />
        <button className="px-6 py-2 bg-black text-white rounded-lg focus:ring-opacity-50">
            Reply
        </button>
    </div>)
})
```

## Why Use Envelope Toast?

- Organize complex messages: Use Envelope Toast to hide or reveal additional details, making your notifications cleaner and more user-friendly.
- Actionable content: Adds an interactive component to the toast, allowing users to engage with the notification, like replying to a message or viewing more details.
- Improved UX: By only showing essential information initially, users are less overwhelmed with data while still having the option to expand and learn more.
- Use cases: Ideal for message notifications, alerts with expandable content, and data-driven toast alerts where the user might want to "unwrap" more information.
