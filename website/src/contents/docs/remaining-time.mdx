# Getting Remaining Time for a Toast

You can use the `toast.remainingTime()` method to retrieve the remaining time before a toast auto-dismisses.

```javascript
const toastId = toast.info("This is an info message");

// Check remaining time for this toast
const remainingTime = toast.remainingTime(toastId);

console.log('Remaining time in milliseconds:', remainingTime);
```

`remainingTime()` accepts one parameter:

- **id**: The ID of the toast whose remaining time you want to check.
